## 🧭 Objective:  
Group states by ideology using unsupervised learning.
## ✍️ Prompt: 
Examine which countries cluster together. What values or policies do they share? Could this method help predict future alliances?

## 📥 Load Data
```{webr-r, lab02c}
library(tidyverse)
library(cluster)

ideology <- read_csv(here::here("assets/datasets/ideology_attributes.csv"))


# The current dataset 'ideology_attributes.csv' contains only categorical data.
# K-means clustering requires numerical data.
# If numerical attributes (e.g., economic_policy, media_freedom) are added to the dataset,
# the following code can be uncommented to perform clustering and visualization.

# set.seed(123)
# clust <- kmeans(ideology[, -1], centers = 3)
# ideology$cluster <- clust$cluster

# ggplot(ideology, aes(x = economic_policy, y = media_freedom, color = factor(cluster))) +
#   geom_point() +
#   labs(title = "Ideological Clustering of States",
#        x = "Economic Policy Score", y = "Media Freedom Score") +
#   theme_minimal()
```
