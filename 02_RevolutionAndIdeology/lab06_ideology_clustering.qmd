## 🧭 Objective:  
Group states by ideology using unsupervised learning.
## ✍️ Prompt: 
Examine which countries cluster together. What values or policies do they share? Could this method help predict future alliances?

## 📥 Load Data
```{r}
library(cluster)
ideology <- read_csv("assets/datasets/ideology_attributes.csv")


set.seed(123)
clust <- kmeans(ideology[, -1], centers = 3)
ideology$cluster <- clust$cluster

ggplot(ideology, aes(x = economic_policy, y = media_freedom, color = factor(cluster))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Ideological Clustering of States",
       x = "Economic Policy Score", y = "Media Freedom Score") +
  theme_minimal()
```
