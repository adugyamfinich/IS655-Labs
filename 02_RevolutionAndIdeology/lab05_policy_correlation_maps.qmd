## 🧭 Objective:  
Evaluate correlations among policy traits adopted by post-revolutionary governments.
## ✍️ Prompt:   
Which policies tend to co-occur across regimes? What ideological connections do these patterns suggest?

## 📥 Setup
```{webr-r, lab02b}
library(tidyverse)

policy_traits <- read_csv(here::here("assets/datasets/governance_traits.csv"))

policy_traits # Display the data frame. More meaningful correlation analysis would require additional numeric columns.
```
