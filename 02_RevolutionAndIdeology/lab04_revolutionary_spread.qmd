## 🧭 Objective: 
Track revolutionary activity from 1789 to 1900 and explore spatial diffusion patterns.

## ✍️ Reflection: 
What patterns emerge? Do revolutionary waves cluster in specific regions or periods? Identify possible causes.

## 📥 Data
```{webr-r, lab02a}
library(tidyverse)

revolutions <- read_csv(here::here("assets/datasets/revolution_events.csv"))

revolutions %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, fill = country)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Revolutionary Events",
       x = "Year", y = "Number of Events") +
  theme_minimal()
```
