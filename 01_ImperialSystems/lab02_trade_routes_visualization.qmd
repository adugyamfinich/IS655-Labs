## 🧭 Objective: 
Visualize major trade flows across empires using commodity-based export data from the 19th century.

## Prompt: 
Which empires specialized in which commodities, and why? Discuss how trade patterns shaped foreign policy strategies.

## 📥 Setup
```{webr-r, lab01b}
library(tidyverse)

trade <- read_csv(here::here("assets/datasets/imperial_trade.csv"))

trade %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = export_value, y = commodity, fill = empire)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Colonial Commodity Exports by Empire",
       x = "Export Value (in millions)", y = "Commodity") +
  theme_bw()
```
