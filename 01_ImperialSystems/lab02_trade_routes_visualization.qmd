## 🧭 Objective
Visualize major trade flows across empires using commodity-based export data from the 19th century.

## 📥 Setup
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
trade <- read_csv("assets/datasets/imperial_trade.csv")

trade %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = export_value, y = commodity, fill = empire)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Colonial Commodity Exports by Empire",
       x = "Export Value (in millions)", y = "Commodity") +
  theme_bw()
```
## ✍️ Prompt
Which empires specialized in which commodities, and why? Discuss how trade patterns shaped foreign policy strategies.
