## 🧭 Objective: 
Quantify the economic and institutional effects of major conflicts.

## ✍️ Prompt: 
Which variables most strongly predict post-war economic decline? What policy implications follow?

## 📥 Load Data
```{r, lab04a}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
conflict_data <- read_csv(here::here("assets/datasets/war_impact.csv"))

# The current dataset 'war_impact.csv' does not contain 'gdp_change' or 'war_duration' columns.
# Therefore, the linear model cannot be performed with the current data.
# If these columns are added to the dataset, the following code can be uncommented.

# model <- lm(gdp_change ~ war_duration + casualties + infrastructure_loss, data = conflict_data)
# summary(model)

```
