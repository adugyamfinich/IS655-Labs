## 🧭 Objective:  
Explore how conflict shapes long-term institutional development.

## ✍️ Prompt:  
Do post-conflict institutions converge or diverge over time? What factors influence these trajectories?

## 📥 Load Data
```{r, lab04c}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
legacy <- read_csv(here::here("assets/datasets/institutional_legacies.csv"))
# The current dataset 'institutional_legacies.csv' does not contain a 'year' column.
# Therefore, time-series plotting is not feasible with this data.
# If time-series data is added, the following code can be uncommented.

# legacy %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x = year, y = legacy_score, color = country)) +
#   geom_line() +
#   labs(title = "Institutional Quality Over Time",
#        x = "Year", y = "Quality Index") +
#   theme_minimal()
```
