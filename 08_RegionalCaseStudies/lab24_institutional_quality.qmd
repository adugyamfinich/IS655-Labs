## 🧭 Objective:   
Evaluate institutional strength using governance indicators across continents.

## ✍️ Prompt:  
Which regions show institutional strengths or weaknesses? How do these patterns align with historical trajectories?

## 📥 Load Data
```{r}
institutions <- read_csv("assets/datasets/institutional_quality.csv")
library(fmsb)

# Prepare data
radar <- institutions %>%
  filter(region %in% c("Africa", "Asia", "Europe")) %>%
  select(region, rule_of_law, transparency, accountability)

radar <- as.data.frame(radar)
radar <- rbind(rep(100, 3), rep(0, 3), radar[,-1])
rownames(radar) <- c("Max", "Min", radar$region)

radarchart(radar, axistype = 1,
           pcol = c("darkred", "darkblue", "darkgreen"),
           plwd = 2, plty = 1,
           title = "Institutional Quality by Region")
